# Domestic Migration Trend Modeling & 10 Year Forward Look

We are building 3 different machine learning models to analyze domestic migration changes from state to state within the United States.  We will take the results of the three separate methodologies and compile a detailed comparison of the results.  We are also running a prediction for 10 years forward from 2020 where our dataset ends.

The datafile that we are utilizing comes from a group of files under "Components of Population Change" found on the website statsamerica.org.  We hope that our analysis will provide a clearer picture of population movements over the last 20 years as well as a forward look of how population demographics could change out to 2030.

The following project guidelines focus on teamwork, your project proposal, data sources, and data cleanup and analysis.

# Support and Resources

Your instructional team will provide support during classes and office hours. You also have access to learning assistants and tutors to help you with topics for which you need additional help. Be sure to take advantage of these resources as you collaborate with your group on this second project.
